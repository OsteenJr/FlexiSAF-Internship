# Simple ES6 Array Methods Demo

This project is a beginner-friendly HTML webpage designed for intermediate frontend developers to learn and practice 10 essential JavaScript array methods, including ES6 additions, as covered in the [W3Schools JavaScript Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) and [ES6 Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp). It uses a simple array with button-driven interactions to demonstrate each method's functionality.

## Purpose

The demo helps intermediate developers:
- Understand key ES6 array methods (`Array.from()`, `find()`, `findIndex()`, `entries()`, `keys()`).
- Reinforce classic methods (`map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, `forEach()`, `some()`).
- Practice frontend skills like DOM manipulation, event listeners, and ES6 arrow functions.
- Build confidence in applying array methods for real-world tasks like data handling in React or form processing.

## Features

- **10 Array Methods Demonstrated:**
  1. `Array.from()`: Converts a string to an array.
  2. `Array.find()`: Finds the first club with more than 5 letters.
  3. `Array.findIndex()`: Finds the index of "Chelsea".
  4. `Array.entries()`: Lists index/value pairs (e.g., `[0, "Arsenal"]`).
  5. `Array.keys()`: Lists array indices (e.g., 0, 1, 2).
  6. `Array.map()`: Transforms clubs to uppercase.
  7. `Array.filter()`: Keeps clubs starting with "A".
  8. `Array.reduce()`: Calculates total length of club names.
  9. `Array.forEach()`: Logs each club.
  10. `Array.some()`: Checks if any club starts with "C".
- **Interactive UI:** Buttons trigger each method, displaying results in the DOM.
- **Minimal Styling:** Clean, simple CSS for readability.
